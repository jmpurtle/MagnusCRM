# Magnus
PHP protocol based framework

## Installation
For the sake of simplicity, just add this project to your vendor folder and make use of the examples in here to build your application. All examples are created as if they were the standard contents of /var/www/ on a web server. Your typical document root would be set up as /var/www/html.

## State
Magnus is in heavy redevelopment. If you're interested in what a Magnus 3.0 type application looks like, have a look at this file: https://github.com/jmpurtle/portfolio/blob/master/html/index.php. This version will serve to clean up and encapsulate the functionality used in that file and make it extendable/testable.
